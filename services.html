            <h2>What is Old Car Insurance?</h2>
            <h3>Old car insurance refers to a type of car insurance that provides coverage to old cars, second-hand cars, or used cars. Car<br> insurance for old cars provides coverage against damages caused to the old car due to accidents, calamities (natural/manmade), theft,<br> etc. It provides the same coverage as a new car insurance plan. Hence, it covers both third-party liabilities and own damage.</h3>
            <h2>Why Is It Important to Insure Second Hand Cars?</h2>
            <h3>It is extremely important to insure an old car. In fact, irrespective of the age of the vehicle, whether it's old or new, buying<br> at least Third-party insurance is mandatory as per law. Here are the top reasons for buying old car insurance policy.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h2>Protects Against Risks:</h2><h3> A Comprehensive Car Insurance Policy provides coverage against damages to your old car <br> in case of mishaps such as an accident, fire damages or damages due to natural/manmade disasters.</h3></li>
                <li><h2>Mandatory for All Vehicles:</h2><h3> It doesnâ€™t matter if you own an old or new car. Purchasing at least a Third-Party<br> Car Insurance Plan is compulsory to comply with the Motor Vehicles Act. Driving a vehicle without a valid motor insurance policy<br> is an offence, and you can be penalised for doing so.</h3></li>
                <li><h2>Third-Party Liability Coverage: </h2><h3>The Old Car Insurance Policy covers damages to third-party property or life. If<br> your old car causes damage to a third party or injures a third party in an accident, the insurance policy will cover such <br>damages/losses.</h3></li>
                <li><h2>Personal Accident Coverage:</h2><h3> An Old Car Insurance Plan not only covers your car but also provides coverage<br> against injury/accidental death of the owner/driver. For instance, if you are injured in a car accident, then the insurance <br>policy will cover the medical expenses incurred due to the treatment of the injury. Note that this is a mandatory cover that <br>needs to be purchased separately.</h3></li>
            </ul>

        <p><h1>How to Transfer Ownership and Insurance of Second Hand Car</h1>
            <h3>When you buy a used car, the first thing to do is transfer the ownership to your name. Similarly, the second-hand car may come<br> with an insurance policy that is valid for a few months/years. Hence, transferring the insurance is also necessary. Here are the <br>steps you can follow to get the vehicle ownership transfer and insurance transfer done.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Visit your respective RTO (Regional Transport Office) and submit the application for vehicle ownership transfer.<br></li>
                <li>Submit all the relevant documents and pay the fees.</li>
                <li>Once the RC transfer is done, you can contact the insurer for the insurance transfer.<br></li>
                <li>Submit the new proposal form along with the relevant documents.</li>
                <li>Pay the insurance transfer fees, and the insurance company will transfer the policy to your name.</li>

        <h1>Car Services</h1>
        <p><h3>Cars are an essential mode of transportation used for leisure activities, work, or travelling purposes. Each new model of a car and <br>its specific feature can determine its driving experience. Cars can be a safe way to commute to avoid close contact with the general<br> public during pandemic situations. A car at home can be very beneficial in case of family health emergencies. Cars offer flexibility in<br> travel and help maintain punctuality. However, since cars are expensive to buy and maintain, not everyone can afford one.  <br>

        Cars are remarkable devices that enable us to travel from one destination to another. They are available in a wide array of colours, <br>shapes, and sizes, and some can travel at remarkable speeds. Cars have four wheels and are propelled by machines known as engines. The<br> interior of a car typically features comfortable seats and, in specific models, even audio entertainment systems. Families frequently <br>use cars for excursions, social visits, or shopping errands. Some vehicles are designed to operate on electricity, which contributes to <br>maintaining clean air. In summary, cars have become integral to our lives, providing convenience and enhancing our experiences. </h3>
